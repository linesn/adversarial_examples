As automated decision-making becomes more popular and more dependent upon
artificial intelligence, securing sensitive models from adversarial behavior
has become essential. Neural networks are particularly vulnerable to
so-called adversarial examples \cite{szegedy2014intriguing}, and various
attacks and defences have been explored in the literature.

Our intention in this paper is to demonstrate and confirm the results of
such attacks at an informative but modest scale. We apply two common attacks
to both the wide ResNet and GoogLeNet neural models, and test two defences,
in a reproducible computational environment. We show that significant
improvements in network robustness are available with minimal defence
measures.
