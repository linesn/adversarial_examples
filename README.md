# Adversarial Examples
A project exploring the use of adversarial examples to defeat classifiers. This project was made as part of Johns Hopkins EN.625.638 Neural Networks course, by students Daniel Donoghue, Nicholas Lines, and Arnaldo Pereira, under the direction of Professor Mark Fleischer.

# Summary Slideshow
Here is a [PDF slideshow](AdversarialExamples.pdf) explaining our project.

# Project paper
We wrote a paper detailing our project that is available [here](Adversarial_Examples_Project_Paper.pdf).
